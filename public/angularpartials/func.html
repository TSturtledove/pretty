  <h1>Functions<h1>
  <p class="cinzelsmall">Functions help you preform special actions with your code.  You can make a calculator, change the color of text on screen, or other numerous tasks.
    One basic function is the "if then" type where the function checks to see if a certain condition has been met and then preforms a task based on that information.</p>
    <p> Another simple function can acutally be the use of a button.  This runs the action of clicking the button
      on the page through the function.  So, for instance, if you click the "Fonts" button at the top of the page here
      right now it acts as if you were clicking a hyperlink and redirects you to the Fonts page; but you could also
      write the code so the Fonts button has a scope value and clicking it activates a function that changes the url location.
      The code for this second part would look something like this,
      " $scope.Fonts = function() {
          $location.url('/fonts')
      }"
      Here, whenever the object that "$scope.Fonts" is asigned to gets activated it runs the function which changes the last part
      of the current url to "/fonts" which in turn redirects the user to that page.</p>
